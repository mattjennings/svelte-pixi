title: Reducing Bundle Size
---

Pixi v8 introduced a [skipExtensionImports](https://pixijs.download/release/docs/rendering.SharedRendererOptions.html) option allows you to opt-out of importing unused extensions. By default,
Pixi dynamically imports all extensions during its asynchronous initialization for Application or Renderer. If you set `skipExtensionImports` to `true`,  these imports will not be loaded
and you can selectively import the extensions you need instead.

```diff live lang="svelte" props={{ bg: 'none' }}  wrapper="/src/layouts/examples/wrappers/Empty.svelte"
<script>
  // important! you will need to include your 
  // used extensions manually **before** importing svelte-pixi
  import 'pixi.js/app'
  import 'pixi.js/text'

  // rest of your imports
  import { Application, Text } from 'svelte-pixi'
</script>

<Application 
  width={400} 
  height={400} 
  antialias
+  skipExtensionImports
>
  <Text
    x={200}
    y={200}
    text="Hello World"
    anchor={0.5}
    style={{ fill: 'white' }}
  />
</Application>
```

## Upgrading from v6/v7

If you were using a custom pixi.js file in v6 or v7 you will need to remove it and go back to using pixi.js regularly.
Pixi v8 overhauled its package structure and a custom pixi.js file can no longer be built this way. 
Remove all `@pixi/*` packages and `npm install pixi.js@latest`.
