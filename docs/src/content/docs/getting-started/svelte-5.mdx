SveltePixi v8 has been upgraded to support Svelte 5 but continues to offer Svelte 4 components for those who have not yet upgraded. You
can use these importing from `svelte-pixi/svelte-4` instead. For the most part the APIs should be similar if not the same.

If you are incrementally upgrading your project to Svelte 5, you _can_ interop these components, but be aware of any issues that inherently
come with mixing Svelte 5 and Svelte 4 (e.g. event handlers and slots/snippets). Svelte 4 components will be dropped in the next major version.

Most examples in the documentation will show versions for both Svelte 5 and Svelte 4.
