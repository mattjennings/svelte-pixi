Breaking changes:

- In Pixi v8 Application and Renderer are now initialiazed asynchronously. The Application and Renderer components are affected in the following ways:

  - Application will call `init()` on the `instance` prop automatically. This can be disabled with `autoInit={false}`.
  - Application renders a `loading` slot while the initialization is in progress. This should be fast enough to not need to use it, but it's there if needed.
  - Application emits an `init` event with `{ detail: { instance } }` when the initialization is complete. Use this to know when the instance is ready, as the bound `instance` will be set before initialization is complete.

  - Renderer will call `autoDetectRenderer()` to set get the renderer if `instance` is not provided. This is an async call and the `loading` slot will be rendered while it awaits, and `instance` will not be bound until it finishes. If `instance` is provided, it will be ready to use immediately.
  - Like Application, Renderer emits an `init` event with `{ detail: { instance } }` when the autoDetectRenderer has complete. But you can also just bind to the `instance` prop as before.

- Application useContextAlpha prop removed, use premultipliedAlpha and backgroundAlpha instead.
- Application forceCanvas prop removed, (unsure why)
- Application instance will be bound before Application.init has finished. Emits `init` event with `{ detail: { instance } }` event.
- Renderer useContextAlpha prop removed, use premultipliedAlpha and backgroundAlpha instead.
- Renderer forceCanvas prop removed, (unsure why)

- pluginName gone? https://github.com/pixijs/pixijs/issues/10311
